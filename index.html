    Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
    never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch
    to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
    field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
    large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
   </p>
   <p>
    The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
    dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
    about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
    deep well.
   </p>
  </div>
  <div class="sidebar-one">
   <h3>Sidebar One</h3>
   <p>
    Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
    plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
    was going to happen next.

  <div class="sidebar-two">

    Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a
    moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was
    another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight,
    hurrying down it.

    It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll
    look first,’ she said, ‘and see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’; for she had read several nice little histories
    about children who had got burnt...

    There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find
    another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a
    little bottle on it, (‘which certainly was not here before,’ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a
    paper label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large letters.

    Presently she began again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall right through
    the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that
    walk with their heads downward!
